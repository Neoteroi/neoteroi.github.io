# Routing

Server side routing refers to the ability of a web application to handle web
requests using different functions, depending on the URL path and HTTP method.
Each BlackSheep application is bound to a router, which provides several ways
to define routes. A function that is bound to a route is called a "request
handler", since its responsibility is to handle web requests and produce
responses.

## Defining request handlers

A request handler is a function used to produce responses. To become request
handlers, functions must be bound to a _route_, that represents a certain
URL path pattern. The `Router` class provides several methods to define request
handlers: with decorators (🗡️ in the table below) and without decorators
(🛡️):

| Router method   | HTTP method | Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| **head**        | HEAD        | 🗡️    |
| **get**         | GET         | 🗡️    |
| **post**        | POST        | 🗡️    |
| **put**         | PUT         | 🗡️    |
| **delete**      | DELETE      | 🗡️    |
| **trace**       | TRACE       | 🗡️    |
| **options**     | OPTIONS     | 🗡️    |
| **connect**     | CONNECT     | 🗡️    |
| **patch**       | PATCH       | 🗡️    |
| **add_head**    | HEAD        | 🛡️    |
| **add_get**     | GET         | 🛡️    |
| **add_post**    | POST        | 🛡️    |
| **add_put**     | PUT         | 🛡️    |
| **add_delete**  | DELETE      | 🛡️    |
| **add_trace**   | TRACE       | 🛡️    |
| **add_options** | OPTIONS     | 🛡️    |
| **add_connect** | CONNECT     | 🛡️    |
| **add_patch**   | PATCH       | 🛡️    |


### With decorators

The following example shows how to define a request handler for the root
path of a web application "/":

```python
from blacksheep import get


@get("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World"
```

Alternatively, the application router offers a `route` method:

```python
from blacksheep import route


@route("/example", methods=["GET", "HEAD", "TRACE"])
async def example():
    # HTTP GET /example
    # HTTP HEAD /example
    # HTTP TRACE /example
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Without decorators

Request handlers can be registered without decorators:

```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World"


app.router.add_get("/", hello_world)
app.router.add_options("/", hello_world)
```

### Request handlers as class methods

Request handlers can also be configured as class methods, defining classes that
inherit the `blacksheep.server.controllers.Controller` class:

```python {hl_lines="4 17 22 27 32"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from blacksheep import Application, text, json
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, get, post


app = Application()


# example input contract:
@dataclass
class CreateFooInput:
    name: str
    nice: bool


class Home(Controller):

    def greet(self):
        return "Hello World"

    @get("/")
    async def index(self):
        # HTTP GET /
        return text(self.greet())

    @get("/foo")
    async def foo(self):
        # HTTP GET /foo
        return json({"id": 1, "name": "foo", "nice": True})

    @post("/foo")
    async def create_foo(self, foo: CreateFooInput):
        # HTTP POST /foo
        # with foo instance automatically injected parsing
        # the request body as JSON
        # if the value cannot be parsed as CreateFooInput,
        # Bad Request is returned automatically
        return json({"status": True})
```

## Route parameters

BlackSheep supports three ways to define route parameters:

* `"/:example"` - using a single colon after a slash
* `"/{example}"` - using curly braces
* `"/<example>"` - using angle brackets (i.e. [Flask notation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/?highlight=routing#variable-rules))

Route parameters can be read from `request.route_values`, or bound
automatically by the request handler's signature:

=== "Using the signature (recommended)"

    ```python {hl_lines="3-4"}
    from blacksheep import get

    @get("/api/cats/{cat_id}")
    def get_cat(cat_id):
        # cat_id is bound automatically
        ...
    ```

=== "Using the Request object"

    ```python {hl_lines="3 6"}
    from blacksheep import Request, get

    @get("/{example}")
    def handler(request: Request):
        # reading route values from the request object:
        value = request.route_values["example"]
        ...
    ```

It is also possible to specify the expected type, using `typing` annotations:

```python
@get("/api/cats/{cat_id}")
def get_cat(cat_id: int):
    ...
```

```python
from uuid import UUID


@get("/api/cats/{cat_id}")
def get_cat(cat_id: UUID):
    ...
```

In this case, BlackSheep will automatically produce an `HTTP 400 Bad Request`
response if the input cannot be parsed into the expected type, producing a
response body similar to this one:

```
Bad Request: Invalid value ['asdas'] for parameter `cat_id`; expected a valid
UUID.
```

## Value patterns

By default, route parameters are matched by any string until the next slash "/"
character. Having the following route:

```python

@get("/api/movies/{movie_id}/actors/{actor_id}")
def get_movie_actor_details(movie_id: str, actor_id: str):
    ...

```

HTTP GET requests having the following paths are all matched:

```
/api/movies/12345/actors/200587

/api/movies/Trading-Places/actors/Denholm-Elliott

/api/movies/b5317165-ad31-47e2-8a2d-42dba8619b31/actors/a601d8f2-a1ab-4f20-aebf-60eda8e89df0
```

However, the framework supports more granular control on the expected value
pattern. For example, to specify that `movie_id` and `actor_id` must be
integers, it is possible to define route parameters this way:

```python
"/api/movies/{int:movie_id}/actors/{int:actor_id}"
```

!!! warning
    Value patterns only affect the regular expression used to match
    requests' URLs. They don't affect the type of the parameter after a web
    request is matched. Use type annotations as described above to enforce types
    of the variables as they are passed to the request handler.

The following value patterns are built-in:

| Value pattern | Description                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `str`         | Any value that doesn't contain a slash "/".                                       |
| `int`         | Any value that contains only numeric characters.                                  |
| `float`       | Any value that contains only numeric characters and eventually a dot with digits. |
| `path`        | Any value to the end of the path.                                                 |
| `uuid`        | Any value that matches the UUID value pattern.                                    |

To define custom value patterns, extend the `Route.value_patterns` dictionary.
The key of the dictionary is the name used by the parameter, while the value is
a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) used to match
the parameter's fragment. For example, to define a custom value pattern for
route parameters composed of exactly two letters between `a-z` and `A-Z`:

```python
Route.value_patterns["example"] = r"[a-zA-Z]{2}"
```

And then use it in routes:

```python
"/{example:foo}"
```

## Catch-all routes

To define a catch-all route that will match every request, use a route
parameter with a path value pattern, like:

* `{path:name}`, or `<path:name>`

```python
from blacksheep import text


@get("/catch-all/{path:sub_path}")
def catch_all(sub_path: str):
    return text(sub_path)
```

For example, a request at `/catch-all/anything/really.js` would be matched by
the route above, and the `sub_path` value would be `anything/really.js`.

It is also possible to define a catch-all route using a star sign `*`. To read
the portion of the path caught by the star sign from the request object, read
the "tail" property of `request.route_values`. But in this case the value of the
caught path can only be read from the request object.

```python

@get("/catch-all/*")
def catch_all(request):
    sub_path = request.route_values["tail"]

```

## Defining a fallback route

To define a fallback route that handles web requests not handled by any other
route, use `app.router.fallback`:

```python
def fallback():
    return "OOPS! Nothing was found here!"


app.router.fallback = fallback
```

## Using sub-routers and filters

The `Router` class supports filters for routes and sub-routers. In the following
example, a web request for the root of the service "/" having a request header
"X-Area" == "Test" gets the reply of the `test_home` request handler, and
without such header the reply of the `home` request handler is returned.

```python {hl_lines="4 6 12-13 17"}
from blacksheep import Application, Router


test_router = Router(headers={"X-Area": "Test"})

router = Router(sub_routers=[test_router])

@router.get("/")
def home():
    return "Home 1"

@test_router.get("/")
def test_home():
    return "Home 2"


app = Application(router=router)
```

A router can have filters based on headers, host name, query string parameters,
and custom user-defined filters.

Query string filters can be defined using the `params` parameter, and host name
filters can be defined using the `host` parameter:

```python
filter_by_query = Router(params={"version": "1"})

filter_by_host  = Router(host="neoteroi.xyz")
```

### Custom filters

To define a custom filter, define a type of `RouteFilter` and set it using the
`filters` parameter:

```python
from blacksheep import Application, Request, Router
from blacksheep.server.routing import RouteFilter


class CustomFilter(RouteFilter):

    def handle(self, request: Request) -> bool:
        # implement here the desired logic
        return True


example_router = Router(filters=[CustomFilter()])
```

## Using the default router and other routers

The examples in the documentation show how to register routes using methods
imported from the BlackSheep package:

```python
from blacksheep import get

@get("")
async def home():
    ...
```

Or, for controllers:

```python
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, get


class Home(Controller):

    @get("/")
    async def index(self):
        ...
```

In this case, routes are registered using **default singleton routers**, used
if an application is instantiated without specifying a router:

```python
from blacksheep import Application


# This application uses the default singleton routers exposed by BlackSheep:
app = Application()
```

This works in most scenarios, when a single `Application` instance per process
is used. For more complex scenarios, it is possible to instantiate a router
and use it as desired:

```python
# app/router.py

from blacksheep import Router


router = Router()
```

And use it when registering routes:

```python
from app.router import router


@router.get("/")
async def home():
    ...
```

It is also possible to expose the router methods to reduce code verbosity, like
the BlackSheep package does:

```python
# app/router.py

from blacksheep import Router


router = Router()


get = router.get
post = router.post

# ...
```


```python
from app.router import get


@get("/")
async def home():
    ...
```

Then specify the router when instantiating the application:

```python {hl_lines="3 7"}
from blacksheep import Application

from app.router import router


# This application uses the router instantiated in app.router:
app = Application(router=router)
```

### Controllers dedicated router

Controllers uses a different kind of router, an instance of
`blacksheep.server.routing.RoutesRegistry`. If using a dedicated router for
controllers is desired, do this instead:

```python
# app/controllers.py

from blacksheep import RoutesRegistry


controllers_router = RoutesRegistry()


get = controllers_router.get
post = controllers_router.post

# ...
```

Then when defining your controllers:

```python {hl_lines="3 8"}
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller

from app.controllers import get, post


class Home(Controller):

    @get("/")
    async def index(self):
        ...
```

```python {hl_lines="3 8"}
from blacksheep import Application

from app.controllers import controllers_router


# This application uses the controllers' router instantiated in app.controllers:
app = Application()
app.controllers_router = controllers_router
```

/// admonition | About Router and RoutesRegistry.
    type: warning

Controller routes use a "RoutesRegistry" to support the dynamic generation
of paths by controller class name. Controller routes are evaluated and
merged into `Application.router` when the application starts.
Since version `2.3.0`, all routes in BlackSheep behave this way and decorators
in `app.router` and `app.router.controllers_routes` can be used
interchangeably.
Before version `2.3.0`, it is _necessary_ to use the correct methods when
defining request handlers: the decorators of the `router.controllers_routes`
for controllers' methods, and the decorators of the `router` for request
handlers defined using functions.

///

## Routing prefix

In some scenarios, it may be necessary to centrally manage prefixes for all
request handlers. To set a prefix for all routes in a `Router`, use the `prefix`
parameter in its constructor.

```python
router = Router(prefix="/foo")
```

To globally configure a prefix for all routes, use the environment variable
`APP_ROUTE_PREFIX` and specify the desired prefix as its value.

This feature is intended for applications deployed behind proxies. For more
information, refer to [_Behind proxies_](./behind-proxies.md).

## How to track routes that matched a request

BlackSheep by default does not track which _route_ matched a web request,
because this is not always necessary. However, for logging purposes it can be
useful to log the route pattern instead of the exact request URL, to reduce
logs cardinality.

One option to keep track of the route that matches a request is to wrap the
`get_match` of the Application's router:

```python
    def wrap_get_route_match(
        fn: Callable[[Request], Optional[RouteMatch]]
    ) -> Callable[[Request], Optional[RouteMatch]]:
        @wraps(fn)
        def get_route_match(request: Request) -> Optional[RouteMatch]:
            match = fn(request)
            request.route = match.pattern.decode()  if match else "Not Found"  # type: ignore
            return match

        return get_route_match

    app.router.get_match = wrap_get_route_match(app.router.get_match)  # type: ignore
```

If monkey-patching methods in Python looks ugly, a specific `Router` class can
be used, like in the following example:

```python
from blacksheep import Application, Router
from blacksheep.messages import Request
from blacksheep.server.routing import RouteMatch


class TrackingRouter(Router):

    def get_match(self, request: Request) -> RouteMatch | None:
        match = super().get_match(request)
        request.route = match.pattern.decode() if match else "Not Found"  # type: ignore
        return match


app = Application(router=TrackingRouter())


@app.router.get("/*")
def home(request):
    return (
        f"Request path: {request.url.path.decode()}\n"
        + f"Request route path: {request.route}\n"
    )
```

If attaching additional properties to the request object also looks suboptimal,
a `WeakKeyDictionary` can be used to store additional information about the
request object, like in this example:

```python
import weakref

from blacksheep import Application, Router
from blacksheep.messages import Request
from blacksheep.server.routing import RouteMatch


class TrackingRouter(Router):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.requests_routes = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()

    def get_match(self, request: Request) -> RouteMatch | None:
        match = super().get_match(request)
        self.requests_routes[request] = match.pattern.decode() if match else "Not Found"
        return match


router = TrackingRouter()

app = Application(router=router)


@app.router.get("/*")
def home(request):
    return (
        f"Request path: {request.url.path.decode()}\n"
        + f"Request route path: {router.requests_routes[request]}\n"
    )
```
