# Controllers

BlackSheep includes built-in features to support the MVC (Model, View,
Controller) architecture. A `Controller` is a class with at least one method
registered as a request handler (i.e., associated with a route). A Controller
is instantiated for each web request when the request matches a route defined
in that controller.

This page describes:

- [X] Controller methods.
- [X] API Controllers.
- [X] Controllers inheritance.

It is recommended to follow the [MVC tutorial](mvc-project-template.md) before
reading this page.

/// admonition | For Flask users.
    type: tip

If you come from Flask, controllers in BlackSheep can be considered
equivalent to Flask's Blueprints, as they allow to group request handlers
in dedicated modules and classes.

## The Controller class

Controllers implement several methods to simplify returning responses. These
are the same described in [Responses](responses.md), but they can be overridden
in subclasses of `Controller` and they remove the need to import functions.

| Method                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### on_request and on_response

Using controllers it is possible to define methods that are always executed
before handling a request and after producing a response:

```python
class Example(Controller):

    async def on_request(self, request: Request):
        print("Received a request!")

    async def on_response(self, response: Response):
        print("Produced response!")
```

Using controllers involves a performance fee compared to using functions because
a controller must be instantiated at each web request, but has the following
benefits:

* Controllers support [dependency injection](dependency-injection.md) to
  receive services for their constructors, in addition to [dependency
  injection](dependency-injection.md) for every single request handler
* Controllers support defining an `on_request(request: Request)` method, that
  gets called at every web request, `on_response(response: Response)` method,
  and a base `route` (defined as class method) for all handlers defined in the
  class.
* Controllers provide methods to produce responses, that can be overridden in
  base classes to personalize the behavior of the application without
  monkey-patching functions

Therefore they can help avoid code repetition.

The following example shows how dependency injection can be used in
controller constructors, and an implementation of the `on_request` method:

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, get


app = Application()


class Settings:

    def __init__(self, greetings: str):
        self.greetings = greetings


app.services.add_instance(Settings(value))


class Home(Controller):

    settings: Settings

    async def on_request(self, request: Request):
        print("[*] Received a request!!")

    def greet(self):
        return self.settings.greetings

    @get("/")
    async def index(self, request: Request):
        return text(self.greet())
```

The dependency can also be described as class property:

```python {hl_lines="2"}
class Home(Controller):
    settings: Settings

    ...
```

If route methods (e.g. `head`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`) from
`blacksheep.server.controllers` are used, then the default singleton `Router`
instance for controllers is used. It is also possible to use a specific router,
as long as this router is bound to the application object:

```python
from blacksheep.server.routing import RoutesRegistry


app = Application()
app.controllers_router = RoutesRegistry()
get = app.controllers_router.get
```

### route classmethod

The `route` `classmethod` can be used to define base routes for all request
handlers defined on a Controller class. In the following example, the actual
routes become: `/home`  and  `/home/about`.

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, get


app = Application()


class Home(Controller):

    @classmethod
    def route(cls):
        return "/home/"

    @get("/")
    def home(self):
        return self.ok({"message": "Hello!"})

    @get("/about")
    def about(self):
        return self.ok({"message": "About..."})
```

## The APIController class

The `APIController` class is a kind of `Controller` dedicated to API
definitions. An APIController offers some properties to simplify versioning of
routes and adding a common path prefix to all routes, for example, prepending
"/v1/" fragment to all routes and the name of the controller class.

```python {hl_lines="5"}
from blacksheep import Response, FromJSON, FromQuery
from blacksheep.server.controllers import APIController, delete, get, patch, post


class Cats(APIController):
    @get()
    def get_cats(
        self,
        page: FromQuery[int] = FromQuery(1),
        page_size: FromQuery[int] = FromQuery(30),
        search: FromQuery[str] = FromQuery(""),
    ) -> Response:
        """Returns a list of paginated cats."""

    @get("{cat_id}")
    def get_cat(self, cat_id: UUID) -> Response:
        """Gets a cat by id."""

    @patch("{cat_id}")
    def update_cat(self, cat_id: str, input: UpdateCatInput) -> Response:
        """Updates a cat with given id."""

    @post()
    def create_cat(self, input: FromJSON[CreateCatInput]) -> Response:
        """Creates a new cat."""

    @delete("{cat_id}")
    def delete_cat(self, cat_id: str) -> Response:
        """Deletes a cat by id."""
```

In the example above, the routes defined on the `Cats` class will result in
the following paths:

| HTTP Method | Path               | Request handler | Description                       |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| GET         | /api/cats          | `get_cats`      | Returns a list of paginated cats. |
| GET         | /api/cats/{cat_id} | `get_cat`       | Gets a cat by id.                 |
| POST        | /api/cats/{cat_id} | `create_cat`    | Creates a new cat.                |
| PATCH       | /api/cats/{cat_id} | `update_cat`    | Updates a cat with given id.      |
| DELETE      | /api/cats/{cat_id} | `delete_cat`    | Deletes a cat by id.              |

To include a version number in the API, implement a `version` `@classmethod`
like in the following example:

```python
class Cats(APIController):

    @classmethod
    def version(cls) -> str:
        return "v1"

    ...
```

In such case, the generated paths would be as follows:

| HTTP Method | Path                  | Request handler | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| HTTP GET    | /api/v1/cats          | `get_cats`      | Returns a list of paginated cats. |
| HTTP GET    | /api/v1/cats/{cat_id} | `get_cat`       | Gets a cat by id.                 |
| HTTP POST   | /api/v1/cats/{cat_id} | `create_cat`    | Creates a new cat.                |
| HTTP PATCH  | /api/v1/cats/{cat_id} | `update_cat`    | Updates a cat with given id.      |
| HTTP DELETE | /api/v1/cats/{cat_id} | `delete_cat`    | Deletes a cat by id.              |


To specify a name for the API, different than the default one, implement a
`route` `@classmethod` like in the following example:

```python
class Cats(APIController):

    @classmethod
    def route(cls) -> str:
        return "catz"

    ...
```

## Controllers inheritance

Since version `2.3.0`, the framework supports routes inheritance in controllers.
Consider the following example:

```python {linenums="1" hl_lines="8-9 12-13 15 21-21"}
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, get


app = Application()


class BaseController(Controller):
    path: ClassVar[str] = "base"

    @classmethod
    def route(cls) -> Optional[str]:
        return f"/api/{cls.path}"

    @get("/foo")  # /api/base/foo
    def foo(self):
        return self.ok(self.__class__.__name__)


class Derived(BaseController):
    path = "derived"

    # /api/derived/foo (inherited from the base class)
```

In the example above, the following routes are configured:

- `/api/base/foo`, defined in `BaseController`
- `/api/derived/foo`, defined in `Derived`

To exclude the routes registered in a base controller class, decorate the class
using the `@abstract()` decorator imported from `blacksheep.server.controllers`.

```python
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, abstract, get


@abstract()
class BaseController(Controller):
    @get("/hello-world")
```

The following example illustrates a scenario in which a base class defines a
`/hello-world` route, inherited in sub-classes that each apply a different
base route. The `ControllerTwo` class defines one more route, which is also
inherited by `ControllerTwoBis`; and this last class defines one more specific
route.

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.controllers import Controller, abstract, get


app = Application()


@abstract()
class BaseController(Controller):
    @get("/hello-world")
    def index(self):
        # Note: the route /hello-world itself will not be registered in the
        # router, because this class is decorated with @abstract()
        return self.text(f"Hello, World! {self.__class__.__name__}")


class ControllerOne(BaseController):
    @classmethod
    def route(cls) -> str:
        return "/one"

    # /one/hello-world


class ControllerTwo(BaseController):
    @classmethod
    def route(cls) -> str:
        return "/two"

    # /two/hello-world

    @get("/specific-route")  # /two/specific-route
    def specific_route(self):
        return self.text(f"This is a specific route in {self.__class__.__name__}")


class ControllerTwoBis(ControllerTwo):
    @classmethod
    def route(cls) -> str:
        return "/two-bis"

    # /two-bis/hello-world

    # /two-bis/specific-route

    @get("/specific-route-2")  # /two-bis/specific-route-2
    def specific_route(self):
        return self.text(f"This is another route in {self.__class__.__name__}")
```

All routes of this example, with their respective response texts, are:

- `/one/hello-world` :material-arrow-right: "Hello, World! ControllerOne"
- `/two/hello-world` :material-arrow-right: "Hello, World! ControllerTwo"
- `/two-bis/hello-world` :material-arrow-right: "Hello, World! ControllerTwoBis"
- `/two/specific-route` :material-arrow-right: "This is a specific route in ControllerTwo"
- `/two-bis/specific-route` :material-arrow-right: "This is a specific route in ControllerTwoBis"
- `/two-bis/specific-route-2` :material-arrow-right: "This is another route in ControllerTwoBis"

Controller types and their dependencies are resolved appropriately for each
request handler,
